# BMI Calculator & Meal Planner

Welcome to our BMI Calculator & Meal Planner project repository! This project is the result of our participation in a recent hackathon, where we aimed to create a user-friendly web application leveraging Machine Learning to promote health and wellness.

## Project Overview

Our web app utilizes ML algorithms to read users' height and weight inputs, calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), and provide tailored meal plans based on their BMI category. We believe that by combining technology and nutrition, we can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health and adopt healthier lifestyles.

## Features

- **BMI Calculation**: Users can input their height and weight, and our ML model calculates their BMI.
- **Meal Planning**: Based on the calculated BMI, the app suggests personalized meal plans from a curated dataset.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web app is designed to be intuitive and accessible to users of all levels.
